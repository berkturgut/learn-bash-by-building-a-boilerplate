# Bash Boilerplate Learning Project

This repository documents my journey through the **Learn Bash by Building a Boilerplate** course from [freeCodeCamp](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/learn-bash-by-building-a-boilerplate). I've organized all the commands I used, the projects I built, and created study materials to help retain what I learned.

## 🎯 What's Here

This repo contains:
- **Learning Progress**: My complete bash command history and course notes
- **Projects Built**: Website boilerplates created during the course
- **Study Notes**: Flashcards I made for reviewing commands later
- **Course Materials**: All instructions and tests from the original course

## 🎯 What I Learned

### Bash Commands
Through 280+ commands, I got comfortable with:
- **Getting around**: `ls` (used 71 times!), `cd`, `pwd`
- **File handling**: `touch`, `mv`, `cp`, `rm`, `mkdir`
- **Viewing content**: `more`, `find`, `clear`
- **Building projects**: Creating organized folder structures for websites

### Study Approach
- **Flashcards**: Made Anki cards to remember commands long-term
- **Two languages**: Created both English and Turkish versions
- **Real examples**: Used actual commands from my practice

## 🚀 How to Use This

### If you want to study with flashcards
1. Check out the cards in `learning-aids/anki_cards_*.md`
2. Import instructions are in `learning-aids/anki_import_instructions_*.md`
3. I use spaced repetition to actually remember stuff

### If you want to see my progress
- **Commands I used**: All 280+ are in `.bash_history`
- **Course notes**: Step-by-step instructions in `learning-aids/dialogues.md`

### If you want to see the projects
- Look at `toms-website/` and `website-boilerplate/` folders

## 📚 Study Files

**Flashcards**: I made these for myself using Anki
- Available in English and Turkish
- Simple tab-separated format
- Based on commands I actually used in the course

**Course notes**: Everything from my learning process
- 280+ command history in `.bash_history`
- 998 lines of course instructions and my notes
- 150+ test files that helped me check progress

## 🛠 What You'll Need

- **Anki**: If you want to use the flashcards
- **Node.js**: To run the tests and website servers
- **Terminal**: To practice bash commands

## 📈 What's Inside

- **My command history**: Every bash command I used (280+ total)
- **Flashcards**: Study cards I made to remember commands
- **Course materials**: All the instructions and tests (998 lines of notes)
- **Two websites**: The boilerplate projects I built during the course
