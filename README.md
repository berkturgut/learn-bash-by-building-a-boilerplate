# Bash Boilerplate Learning Project

This project is a fork of the **Learn Bash by Building a Boilerplate** course from [CodeRoad](https://coderoad.io/). The goal is to learn Bash commands, build a website boilerplate, and document the learning process systematically. The project includes progress made during the course, commands used, and learning materials created.

## Project Contents
This repository includes the following components:
1. **Course Commits**: All Git commits made to complete the course steps on CodeRoad. Each commit represents a part of the course and tracks progress.
2. **Bash History**: A record of Bash commands used during the course, showcasing practical applications of learned commands.
3. **Course Dialogues**: Course instructions and hints, providing context for the learning process.
4. **Anki Card Sets**:
   - **Turkish**: `bash_boilerplate_anki_tr.md` – Turkish Anki cards in tab-separated format, adhering to Dr. Piotr Wozniak’s *Twenty Rules of Formulating Knowledge*.
   - **English**: `bash_boilerplate_anki_en.md` – English Anki cards in tab-separated format, following the same rules.
5. **Anki Import Instructions**: `anki_import_instructions_en.md` – Step-by-step instructions for creating and importing Anki cards.

## Objectives
- **Bash Learning**: Master Bash commands (e.g., `pwd`, `ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`, `mv`, etc.) through practical application.
- **Boilerplate Creation**: Build a website boilerplate to enhance file and folder management skills.
- **Learning Materials**: Reinforce learning with Turkish and English Anki cards.
- **Process Documentation**: Transparently document the learning process with commits, Bash history, and course dialogues.
- **Sharing**: Showcase the project on GitHub to share with other learners.

## Usage
- **Review Commits**: Check the commit history to see course steps and progress.
- **Bash History**: Review the Bash history to examine commands used.
- **Anki Cards**: Import `bash_boilerplate_anki_tr.md` and `bash_boilerplate_anki_en.md` into Anki using the instructions in `anki_import_instructions_en.md`.
- **Course Dialogues**: Read the dialogues to understand the course instructions and context.

## About Anki Cards
The Anki cards are designed according to **Dr. Piotr Wozniak’s Twenty Rules of Formulating Knowledge**:
- **Simplicity**: Each card targets a single piece of information.
- **Cloze Deletion**: 10-20% of cards use cloze deletion for critical information.
- **Mnemonic**: Memorable phrases (e.g., `cd ..` as “go up one floor”).
- **Context**: Examples and source information provide context.
- Cards are presented in tab-separated format with **Question**, **Answer**, **Example**, and **Source** fields.
